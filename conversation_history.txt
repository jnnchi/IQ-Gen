Cuz I'll be pretty busy like after from 24 to 27 well, I'll be pretty busy after

Next interview question: Can you tell us about a time when you had a busy schedule and how you managed your time effectively?
How do you prioritize tasks and manage your workload during busy periods?
Can you walk us through your approach to time management and organization?

Your tone result: Your response seemed neutral here. While this isnt an outstanding concern, try to sound a little more excited next question.
