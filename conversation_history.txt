Alright, well I'm no rapper fam. Um, this was a great interview. Thank you so much for having me. Um, yeah, I'll see you next time. Thank you.

Next interview question: Can you tell us about a time when you had to think on your feet during a project and how you handled it?
As a team player, how do you handle conflicts or disagreements within a team?
